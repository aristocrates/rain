rain
====

A project to simulate the probability that it is raining in Seattle.

If one asks their friends whether or not it is raining in Seattle right now,
and you can assume that each independently lies with some probability,
the probability that it is actually raining depends on the prior probability
of rain in Seattle, as this simulation shows.
